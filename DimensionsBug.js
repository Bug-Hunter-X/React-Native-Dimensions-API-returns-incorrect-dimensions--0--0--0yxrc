This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  Sometimes, the dimensions returned are incorrect or zero, especially when the app is initially launched or after screen rotation. This is inconsistent and can lead to layout issues and crashes.

```javascript
// Incorrect dimensions
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log(width, height); // May return 0, 0 or incorrect values
```
